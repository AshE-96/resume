## Compiling the LaTeX Resume

To generate a PDF resume from the LaTeX source code (e.g., `resume.tex`), you'll need a LaTeX distribution installed on your system.

**Compilation Steps:**

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```
    git clone 
    cd 
    ```

2.  **Compile the LaTeX file:** In your terminal, navigate to the repository directory and run:
    ```bash
    pdflatex resume.tex
    ```

3.  **View the PDF:** The compiled PDF resume (`resume.pdf`) will be created in the same directory.

**LaTeX Package Dependencies:**

*(List the LaTeX packages used in your template here, similar to the previous response's example.)*

## Customization

To customize this resume template with your own information:

1.  **Edit the LaTeX source file (`resume.tex` or your filename):** Open the `.tex` file in a LaTeX editor and replace the example data with your own details in each section.
2.  **Recompile the LaTeX file:** After making changes, recompile the LaTeX file using the `pdflatex` command to generate the updated PDF resume.
3.  **Experiment with layout and styling:**  LaTeX offers extensive customization options. You can adjust fonts, margins, colors, and other styling elements in the LaTeX source code to further personalize your resume.
